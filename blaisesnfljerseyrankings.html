  <h3>Blaise's Top 5 NFL Jersey Rankings</h3>
  <ol>
    <img src="images/denver_blue_.jpg" alt="Denver Broncos' Home Alt.">
    <li><b>Denver Broncos</b>, <a href="images/denver_blue_.jpg"></a>Home Alt.</li>
    <p>Denver Broncos introduced their newest blue jersey in 1997 and wore it for each home game until the arrival of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning">Peyton Manning</a> in 2013. The blue jersey has since been one of my
      favorites.</p>
    <<img src="images/dolphins-1984.jpg" alt="Miami Dolphins' 1984 Home Alt.">
      <li><b>Miami Dolphins</b>, <a href="images/dolphins-1984.jpg"></a>1984 Home Alt.</li>
      <p>I love these 1970's Home jerseys!<a href="https://www.fivereasonssports.com/voices/10-reasons-the-miami-dolphins-throwbacks-must-be-permanent/">The majority of the fanbase wants Miami to go back to these permenently.</a>The Dolphins have
        worn
        these uniforms as Home alternates since the 2015 season.</p>
      <li><b>Carolina Panthers</b>, <a href="images/panthers-away.jpg"></a>Classic Away</li>
      <p>The Carolinas were granted a football team in October, 1993, and since their inception, the team has rocked some great-looking jerseys away from Charlotte.</p>
      <li><b>New Orleans Saints</b>, <a href="images/saints_away.jpg"></a>Classic Away</li>
      <p>New Orleans gave the Saints a new look in 2000 with these sharp away uniforms. The black numbers, the gold outline of those numbers, and the white jersey make an incredible Away uniform.</p>
      <li><b>Washington Football Team/Redskins</b>, <a href="images/washington_home.jpg"></a>Classic Home</li>
      <p>The then Washington Redskins, introduced this uniform in 2000, too and something about these burgundy and gold home uniforms always sat right with me. The uniqueness of it, the rich, bright colors, the simple, yet imtimdating flair to it.
        Great color combo if you ask me.</p>
